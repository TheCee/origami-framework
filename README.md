# Origami Framework

> A universal symbolic reasoning architecture for GPT-native AI

Origami is a domain-agnostic logic control system for building symbolic, auditable, and deterministic GPTs. It enables full transparency of reasoning using a constraint → pattern → synthesis model, augmented by Fact/Inference/Interpretation (F/I/P) tagging. Origami is fully deployable in native GPT environments, with no external plugins, APIs, or retrieval dependencies.

## 🔍 What Makes Origami Unique?

| Feature                  | Origami Framework          | Others (LangChain, Logic-LM, etc.) |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Symbolic logic structure | ✅ Constraint → Pattern → Synthesis | ⚠️ Partial or non-explicit         |
| F/I/P reasoning tagging  | ✅ Built-in                | ❌ Not available                    |
| Audit scaffold output    | ✅ YAML/Markdown          | ❌ Rare or unavailable              |
| Deployment native to GPT| ✅ No plugins or APIs     | ❌ Requires external tooling        |
| Dual-mode logic          | ✅ Research + Compliance  | ⚠️ Experimental                     |
