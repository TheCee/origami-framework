# Origami Framework

> A universal symbolic reasoning architecture for GPT-native AI

Origami is a constraint-driven, symbolic reasoning framework that enables GPTs to produce transparent, auditable, and deterministic outputs. It enforces a strict logic chain — Constraint → Pattern → Synthesis — and tags each reasoning step as Fact (F), Inference (I), or Interpretation (P).

## Key Features

- 🔐 Zero-hallucination symbolic logic
- ⚙️ Fully GPT-native: no APIs, no plugins
- 📄 YAML + Markdown audit scaffolding
- 🔍 Dual modes: Research & Compliance
- 🧪 Successfully used to solve Kryptos K4

## Core Files

- `ORIGAMI_SPEC.yaml` – Formal logic specification
- `examples/kryptos-k4.md` – Historic cryptographic application
- `modules/audit_cert.md` – Output verification module
