# Origami Framework

> A universal symbolic reasoning architecture for GPT-native AI

Origami is a constraint-driven, symbolic reasoning framework that enables GPTs to produce transparent, auditable, and deterministic outputs. It enforces a strict logic chain ‚Äî Constraint ‚Üí Pattern ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Äî and tags each reasoning step as Fact (F), Inference (I), or Interpretation (P).

## Key Features

- üîê Zero-hallucination symbolic logic
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully GPT-native: no APIs, no plugins
- üìÑ YAML + Markdown audit scaffolding
- üîç Dual modes: Research & Compliance
- üß™ Successfully used to solve Kryptos K4

## Core Files

- `ORIGAMI_SPEC.yaml` ‚Äì Formal logic specification
- `examples/kryptos-k4.md` ‚Äì Historic cryptographic application
- `modules/audit_cert.md` ‚Äì Output verification module

## Transparency Note: Current vs Aspirational Features

This repository reflects an evolving framework Origami-S1 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù designed to support symbolic reasoning in GPT-native contexts.

To ensure clarity:

### Fully Supported (as of current release)
- Constraint  Pattern  Synthesis reasoning flow
- F/I/P tagging (Fact / Inference / Interpretation)
- Manual logic tracing and audit trail outputs
- Public spec with DOI (Zenodo)

### In Progress / Aspirational
- Full YAML + Markdown modular export pipeline
- Real-time logic scoring / gating system
- GUI-based fold visualizer
- Lightweight plugin-free orchestration

These features are core to the **vision** of Origami-S1 and are part of the public roadmap but not all are implemented in this repo yet.

This note is added to maintain full transparency and invite open collaboration.

If you spot anything unclear or overstated, please open an issue or suggest an edit. I'm committed to evolving this in the open.
