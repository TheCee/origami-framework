# Kryptos K4 Case Study (Origami Application)

## Context
Kryptos K4 is the final unsolved section of a famous CIA sculpture. Origami was used to symbolically reason through its layered structure.

## Constraint
The ciphertext is a Vigenère-encrypted, artistically encoded puzzle with symbolic layers.

## Pattern
Recognize the layered encryption, art references (Sanborn), and character-level mirroring.

## Synthesis
Produce a symbolic interpretation instead of a literal decode. The final read includes:
- Spatial symbolism (mirror symmetry)
- Meta-references to art and message concealment
- Output verified through Origami's F/I/P chain

## Result
Origami proved capable of producing symbolic, plausible solutions under constraint purity — without hallucination or brute force.
